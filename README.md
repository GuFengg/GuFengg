- 👋 Hi, I’m @GuFengg
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming more familiar with Java, learning how to improve/update old Minecraft mods, and eventually creating games or applications. I'm Also interested in Web/Webapp development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, and re-educating myself on Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (which I only know the basics of).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything people could use a hand on - even if not directly coding/scripting - so long as I can learn from it.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
